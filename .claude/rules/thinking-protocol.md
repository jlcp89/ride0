# Think Before Coding

Before editing any source file, run through SAIV:

**Scope** — What exactly changes? What must NOT change?
**Approach** — Simplest path? What are the alternatives?
**Impact** — What could break? What depends on the code being changed?
**Verify** — How will you prove it works? (see `verification.md`)

## When This Applies

- Ad-hoc code changes (not driven by a skill workflow)
- Skills like /new-feature and /debugging have their own structured thinking — this fills the gap for everything else

## Anti-Patterns

- Jumping straight to editing without reading the surrounding code
- Changing a function signature without checking all call sites
- "Quick fix" that ignores the broader context
- Modifying test assertions to make them pass instead of fixing the code
